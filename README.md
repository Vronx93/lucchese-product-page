# Lucchese Product Page Clone

This project is a frontend implementation of a **product detail page**, inspired by the design and functionality of the original [Lucchese – Priscilla Suede Espresso](https://www.lucchese.com/products/priscilla-suede-espresso) page.  
It was developed as part of a **recruitment task**.
